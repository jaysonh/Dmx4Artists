## How to install Dmx4Artists

### Install with the Contribution Manager

Add contributed Libraries by selecting the menu item _Sketch_ → _Import Library..._ → _Add Library..._ This will open the Contribution Manager, where you can browse for Dmx4Artists, or any other Library you want to install.

Not all available Libraries have been converted to show up in this menu. If a Library isn't there, it will need to be installed manually by following the instructions below.

### Manual Install

Contributed Libraries may be downloaded separately and manually placed within the `libraries` folder of your Processing sketchbook. To find (and change) the Processing sketchbook location on your computer, open the Preferences window from the Processing application (PDE) and look for the "Sketchbook location" item at the top.

By default the following locations are used for your sketchbook folder: 
  * For Mac users, the sketchbook folder is located inside `~/Documents/Processing` 
  * For Windows users, the sketchbook folder is located inside `My Documents/Processing`

Download Dmx4Artists from www.jaysonh.com

Unzip and copy the contributed Library's folder into the `libraries` folder in the Processing sketchbook. You will need to create this `libraries` folder if it does not exist.

The folder structure for Library Dmx4Artists should be as follows:

```
Processing
  libraries
    Dmx4Artists
      examples
      library
        Dmx4Artists.jar
      reference
      src
```
             
Some folders like `examples` or `src` might be missing. After Library Dmx4Artists has been successfully installed, restart the Processing application.

### Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble, have a look at the [Processing Wiki](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/How-to-Install-a-Contributed-Library) for more information, or contact the author [Jayson Haebich](http://www.jaysonh.com).
